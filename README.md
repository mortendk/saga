# What is this
Saga is a  small cms build for webdesigners who wants to control the markup & not have to hassle with databases

Its a try to get back to the late 90'ies and build flatfile sites that could be dropped into any ftp server ... oooh the glory days!

## Core Values
- No DB markdown ftw
- 100% Markup control
- Small tech stack (ish...)
- Build for Web Designers
- Easy to hand down to
- Able to deploy on netlify/github pages or move to other host for simple sftp deployment
- Easy to build the site with no interfearence from a system
- At the end "its just html, css, js" :)

## Tech stack
- 11ty generating the html.
- Markdown, json and nunjucks.
- Git for storage (github).
- Deploy on what you want (ftp / netlify / github pages).
- Netlifycms for online editing.
- Tailwind for css
- Alpine js for interactivity

## But I want a CMS for a client
saga uses netlifycms out the box for easy administration of the markdown files

## Quick start
0. get 11ty
```
npm install -g @11ty/eleventy
```

1. install saga
```
npm install
```
2. spin up the site
```
npm run start
```

3. build minified css
```

```

## Requirements:

- Nunjucks https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/

CMS interface for markdown files
- Netlifycms https://www.netlifycms.org/


## CMS -Netlify CMS
To make the cms editing to work locally
first run the cmsproxy
```
npx netlify-cms-proxy-server
```

then start the build
```
npm run start
```

http://localhost:8080/admin

## Visual regression test
Install Backstop for visual regression test on local setup
```npm install -g backstopjs```

configure in `backstop.json`


### Workflow:
First make sure a local version is running as production `netlify dev`

#### First run
``` $ netlify dev```
Build the reference images
`backstop reference`

then we can test - do the changes and then we cant test up against the reference images
`backstop test`

If its cool and approved we can add the changes to the references with approve
`backstop approve`

`backstop openReport`
